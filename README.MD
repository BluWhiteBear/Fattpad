Terminology:
"Works" - Written content created by users
"Authors" - Users who create and publish works
"Readers" - Users who read, comment on, and rate works
"Collection" - A grouping of works. These can be created by authors to group their own works, or by readers to group works
"Tags" - Keywords assigned to works to categorize them by genre, theme, or subject matter
"Bookmarks" - A feature allowing readers to place a checkpoint within a work for easy return later

When authors populate a work's tags before publishing, tags that are already in the system will be suggested to them
User created tags that closely resemble existing tags will also be suggested to prevent tag duplication
Synonyms will be automatically added to works based on their tags to improve searchability
When searching for works via tags, synonyms will also be searched to improve search results
